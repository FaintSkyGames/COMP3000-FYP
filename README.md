# Iron Defiance
### COMP3000 Final Year Project
Project supervisor - Paul Watson


### Overview
Iron Defiance is a multiplayer proof of concept game. It shows that players can enjoy playing a game with each other while each playerâ€™s goal is based on a different game genre, without reducing the communication expected from a co-op game. For this proof of concept, one player will experience a shooter game and the other will experience a puzzle game.
